# Day 15: Add Binary Strings

**Problem:**
Given two binary strings `a` and `b`, return their sum as a binary string.

**Example:**
```
Input: a = "11", b = "1"
Output: "100"
```

**Approach:**
- Traverse both strings from end to start.
- Add corresponding digits and carry.
- Append result and finally reverse it.
